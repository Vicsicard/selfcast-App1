[Interviewer] Tell me about your background and experience in entrepreneurship.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
[John] I've been an entrepreneur for over 10 years. Started my first company right out of college, a software development firm.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:25.000
[John] We focused on building custom solutions for small businesses. It was challenging at first, but we learned a lot about the market.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
[Interviewer] What were some of the biggest challenges you faced?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:45.000
[John] The biggest challenge was definitely scaling the business. Finding the right talent, managing cash flow, and maintaining quality while growing rapidly.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[John] We had to be very strategic about which clients we took on and how we structured our teams to deliver the best results.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
[Interviewer] How did you overcome those challenges?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:20.000
[John] We implemented better project management systems, invested in training our team, and focused on building long-term relationships with our clients rather than just taking on any project that came our way.
